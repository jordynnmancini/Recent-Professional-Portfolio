# Recent-Professional-Portfolio

## Description
This is my most up-to-date portfolio showcasing my work. It contains 6 examples of homework assignments & group projects that have been developed and deployed. I used a template from HTML5 UP and added my own spin on it. You can view my portfolio here: https://jordynnmancini.github.io/Recent-Professional-Portfolio/
